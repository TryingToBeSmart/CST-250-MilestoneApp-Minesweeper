Milestone 1: Board class creates a 2 dimensional array of Cell objects.  It sets the Cells as bombs depending on the difficulty that was selected.  Then, it sets the LiveNeighbors number of each cell after counting how many neighbors are bombs.  For now, this first commit is just a console app that constructs a board and prints it out.
